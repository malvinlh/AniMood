# AniMood

AniMood is used for Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on an anime review dataset. Through this process, we identified the top 20 positive and top 20 negative anime based on the MAL review dataset as per 2020. In addition, topic modeling was employed through LDA visualization to gain insights into user preferences for anime genres or types. In the LDA visualization, the largest bubble represents the most dominant topic in the corpus of documents, indicating the most frequently occurring and influential theme. Smaller bubbles correspond to topics with lower overall weights in the corpus, signifying less dominant themes. These visualizations not only helped us rank anime by sentiment but also provided valuable insights into the kinds of anime that resonate most with users.
